# Todousa

Simple yet effective TODO app, aimed at easing the everyday life by allowing the user to put every task/project/reminder/reference into a trusted system.

The app is based on the great book *[Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](https://gettingthingsdone.com)* by David Allen, with small modifications focused on ease of use/clarity.
